# ADR-002: Security Architecture and Threat Model

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-08-18

## Context

The ModelCard Generator handles sensitive ML model data including performance metrics, training data descriptions, and potentially proprietary information. We need a comprehensive security architecture to protect this data and ensure compliance with security standards.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered security architecture with the following components:

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
- All user inputs will be validated against strict schemas
- File uploads will be scanned for malicious content
- Template inputs will be sanitized to prevent injection attacks

### 2. Data Protection
- Sensitive data at rest will be encrypted using AES-256
- All API communications will use TLS 1.3
- Credentials will be managed through secure vaults (not environment variables)

### 3. Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for multi-user environments
- API key authentication for programmatic access
- Audit logging for all data access operations

### 4. Secure Defaults
- All features will be secure by default
- Opt-in for features that may have security implications
- Regular security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Consequences

### Positive
- Comprehensive protection against common attack vectors
- Compliance with enterprise security requirements
- Trust from users handling sensitive ML data

### Negative
- Additional complexity in implementation
- Performance overhead from security measures
- Need for security expertise in the development team

## Implementation Notes

- Use industry-standard libraries for cryptographic operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Security-focused code review process
- Threat modeling sessions for new features
