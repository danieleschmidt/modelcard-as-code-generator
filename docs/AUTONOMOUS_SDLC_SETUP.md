## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: GitHub Actions Setup (5 minutes)

#### Step 1.1: Copy Workflow Files
```bash
# Create the workflows directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy all workflow files from templates
cp docs/github-workflows-templates/ci.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/github-workflows-templates/release.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/github-workflows-templates/security.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/github-workflows-templates/performance.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/github-workflows-templates/chaos-engineering.yml .github/workflows/

# Copy dependabot configuration
cp docs/github-workflows-templates/dependabot.yml .github/
```

#### Step 1.2: Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add:

```bash
# Required Secrets
PYPI_API_TOKEN          # For PyPI package publishing
GITHUB_TOKEN            # Automatically provided by GitHub

# Optional but Recommended  
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL       # For notifications
GITLEAKS_LICENSE        # GitLeaks Pro (if available)

# Infrastructure (if using Terraform)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       # AWS credentials
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   # AWS credentials  
DATADOG_API_KEY         # Monitoring integration
DATADOG_APP_KEY         # Monitoring integration
```

#### Step 1.3: Configure Environments
Create environments in **Settings > Environments**:

**Production Environment:**
- Protection rules: Require reviewers
- Deployment branches: `main` only
- Environment secrets: Add `PYPI_API_TOKEN`

**Staging Environment:**
- Deployment branches: `main`, `develop`

### Phase 2: Repository Configuration (10 minutes)

#### Step 2.1: Branch Protection Rules
Configure in **Settings > Branches** for `main`:

```yaml
Protection Rules:
- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Required status checks:
  - "Security & Compliance Scan"
  - "Code Quality & Standards"
  - "Tests (Python 3.11)"
  - "Performance & Benchmarks"
- ✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
- ✅ Require signed commits (recommended)
```

#### Step 2.2: General Settings
In **Settings > General**:
- ✅ Allow merge commits
- ✅ Allow squash merging  
- ✅ Allow rebase merging
- ✅ Automatically delete head branches
- ✅ Enable Dependabot security updates

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Setup (Optional - 30 minutes)

#### Step 3.1: Terraform Infrastructure
```bash
# Navigate to terraform directory
cd terraform/

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan infrastructure deployment
terraform plan -var="environment=prod"

# Apply infrastructure (after review)
terraform apply -var="environment=prod"
```

#### Step 3.2: Kubernetes Configuration
```bash
# Apply production Kubernetes configuration
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/production/

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n modelcard-production
```

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing (15 minutes)

#### Step 4.1: Trigger Initial Workflows
```bash
# Create a test commit to trigger workflows
git add .
git commit -m "feat: enable advanced SDLC workflows"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 4.2: Monitor Workflow Execution
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Monitor the execution of all workflows
3. Check for any configuration issues
4. Review security scan results

#### Step 4.3: Performance Baseline
```bash
# Manual trigger performance workflow to establish baseline
# Go to Actions > Performance Monitoring > Run workflow
```
