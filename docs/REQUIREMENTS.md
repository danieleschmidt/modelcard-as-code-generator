# Requirements Document
## Model Card as Code Generator

### 1. Problem Statement

Manual creation and maintenance of model cards for machine learning models is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to keep synchronized with model changes. Organizations need automated generation of standardized model documentation that satisfies regulatory requirements and enables "card drift" detection in CI/CD pipelines.

### 2. Success Criteria

#### Primary Success Metrics
- **Automation Coverage**: 95% of model card content auto-generated from source artifacts
- **Standards Compliance**: Support for Hugging Face, Google Model Cards, and EU CRA formats
- **CI/CD Integration**: Successful drift detection with <5% false positives
- **Time Savings**: 80% reduction in manual model card creation time

#### Secondary Success Metrics
- **Developer Adoption**: Used in 100% of ML projects within organization
- **Compliance Score**: 100% pass rate for regulatory audits
- **Documentation Quality**: Model cards with >90% completeness score
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Automated updates reduce manual maintenance by 90%
