# Project Charter
## Model Card as Code Generator

### Executive Summary

The Model Card as Code Generator project aims to revolutionize machine learning model documentation by providing automated, standardized, and compliance-ready model cards that integrate seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines.

### Project Scope

#### In Scope
- Automated model card generation from ML artifacts
- Support for multiple model card standards (Hugging Face, Google, EU CRA)
- CI/CD pipeline integration via CLI and GitHub Actions
- Regulatory compliance validation and reporting
- Drift detection and automated updates
- Integration with major ML platforms (MLflow, Weights & Biases, DVC)

#### Out of Scope
- Model training or inference capabilities
- Data preprocessing or feature engineering
- Model deployment infrastructure
- Real-time model monitoring beyond card updates

### Problem Statement

Machine learning teams face significant challenges in creating and maintaining comprehensive model documentation:

1. **Manual Documentation Burden**: Creating model cards is time-consuming and error-prone
2. **Inconsistent Standards**: Different formats and requirements across organizations
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Increasing requirements for ML transparency and accountability
4. **Documentation Drift**: Model cards become outdated as models evolve
5. **Integration Gaps**: Poor integration between ML workflows and documentation processes

### Success Criteria

#### Primary Objectives
1. **Automation Rate**: 90%+ of model card content generated automatically
2. **Compliance Coverage**: Support for GDPR, EU AI Act, and other major frameworks
3. **Integration Breadth**: Compatible with 5+ major ML platforms
4. **User Adoption**: 1000+ active users within 12 months
5. **Time Savings**: 80%+ reduction in documentation time

#### Secondary Objectives
1. **Quality Score**: 95%+ accuracy in generated content
2. **Performance**: Generate standard cards in <30 seconds
3. **Community Growth**: 100+ external contributions
4. **Enterprise Adoption**: 10+ enterprise customers
